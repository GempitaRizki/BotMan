<h1>BotMan Chat </h1>

In a nutshell, this application was created using materials found on BotMan's official website.

This program still has lots of issues, including the following:

1. There is only one way to talk.<br>
<br>

2. The responses' content has not been prepared or has been predetermined in this manner.<br>

<br>

Perhaps this application will be upgraded once again in the future so that it can be used with WebSocket in the future and that the responses to this dialogue are unrelated to preexisting values.
